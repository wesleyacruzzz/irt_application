# Item Response Theory - An application to assess student's grades

I created this web application for a company I founded alongside two colleagues. We specialized in using statistics to assess students scores in national tests with Item Response Theory (IRT).

This application was meant to be used by students and teachers alike, so there are two separete sections in this application.

We tested this MVP with mock data, so no person in our dataset exists in real life.
